# Final Project
Congratulations on making it to the end of the course! New Media I was probably one of the more technical classes 
you've taken in the Media Production program. You've learned a lot of new skills and concepts that will help you not 
only in web design, but also video production, audio production, graphic design, and more.

## Assignment
Use this repository to create a final project that showcases everything you've learned in this course. You have a 
few weeks to work on this as well as in-person workshops. Be sure to take advantage of the time given and these 
in-person workshops to get help from your peers and instructor. The goal of this assignment is to showcase your HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, and design skills learned in this course. When done, you will have a portfolio piece that you can show 
off to potential employers!

Your job as a web designer to create websites that are aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and functional. You have 
been approached by a client (you choose) to either redesign or create a new website for them.

> __NOTE:__ This is _not_ an opportunity to create a personal portfolio site. You will have the opportunity to do that 
> later in the program.

### Potential Clients
If you need some ideas for potential redesigns, here are some ideas:
- [Cocca's Pizza](https://www.coccaspizza.com/)
- [Pasquale's Newport](http://www.pasqualesnewport.com/)
- [Arcade Legacy](https://www.arcadelegacyohio.com/)

## Requirements
- You must have a homepage that captures the attention of the user (think "above the fold")
- You must have at least 3 other pages (`about.html`, `contact.html`, etc.)
- You must have a navigation bar that links to all of your pages
- You must have a footer with supplemental information (social media links, copyright, contact information, etc.)
- All content should be original (no lorem ipsum)
- All media should work in all browsers (`video`, `audio`, `img`, etc.)
- All links should work in all browsers
- All CSS and JavaScript should be in separate files and linked to your HTML files
- All HTML should be valid and semantic
- Website should be deployed to GitHub Pages (details below)

JavaScript (jQuery) is not required, but is encouraged. If you have an image gallery, it's a good idea to use 
something like a "lightbox" plugin to make it easier for the user to view the images.

## Recommendations
- Create wireframes for your website before you start coding
- Use CSS Grid for layouts and Flexbox for smaller elements (avoid floats)
- Use jQuery for any JavaScript functionality (if you choose to use it)
- Use a CSS library like Bootstrap or Tailwind to help with page layouts

It's also recommended to follow the project structure provided to you in this repository. All of your `.css` files 
should be in the `css` folder, all of your `.js` files should be in the `js` folder, and all of your images should 
be in the `img` folder. Any `.html` files can be in the root directory.

## Grading
This assignment is worth `30` points or the equivalent of 3 assignments. Your instructor will make sure that all of 
the requirements have been met and that your website is functional. You will also be graded on the following:

- Organization of your code
- Use of semantic HTML
- Use of CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Overall design, aesthetics, and functionality

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to host your website for free. It's a great way to show off your 
website via a web address (URL) that you can share with others. To deploy your website to GitHub Pages, follow the following steps:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Source should e "deploy from a branch" and the branch should be "main"
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait a few minutes for your website to deploy. When complete, you will see a message that says "Your site is live 
   at: https://uc-media-production.github.io/your-repo-name/"

Example: `https://uc-media-production.github.io/final-project-daveberning/`

When deployed to GitHub Pages, your website will be updated after every commit to the `main` branch.

## Submission
When complete, copy and paste your GitHub Pages URL into the URL field in Canvas.
